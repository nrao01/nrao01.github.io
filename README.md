In this project, I created a website in which there is a homepage (written in index.html), a short bio (written in bio.html), and a resume (written in resume.html).
All of the required parts of the assignment have been completed. One thing that I wish I had done differently in this project, was to create only one CSS file, rather than a different file for each of the three HTML files.

On this project, I collaborated with Minal Mirpuri, Iris Oliver, and Bianca Cappretta.

I spent about 8 hours on this assignment.
